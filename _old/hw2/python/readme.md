## Running
If you want to use Docker, you can get started after cloning the repo by runing `sh entry.sh`. The Jupyter Lab environment should open in your web browser (no token/password required).

Locally, you can run `jupyter lab` in the cloned projects main directory. Dependancies should be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and the jupyter lab extensions can be installed with `sh postBuild`.
